[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-h9gxht)

I used a online editor from https://stackblitz.com/ to deploy this code , all you have to do is link your github acount with their website the press commit button to push latest changes

Normal if i work on local i use the following steps.
1. Create an new repository on github
2. Open terminal
3. cd to where the folder of the code you want to push
4. git init
5. git add .
6. git status
7. git commit -m "First commit"
8. git remote add origin https://github.com/ntunah/RomanNumericalConvertor.git
9. git push -u origin main
10. enter username and password
